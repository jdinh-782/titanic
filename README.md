# Titanic
Machine learning model analyzing passenger information to predict who survived from the Titanic disaster.

## Description
The provided notebook reads in the train dataset which consists of passenger information crucial to understanding who may have survived. Data is cleaned and split into features for model/method analysis. There are multiple ensemble methods and models to test the training data and predict those who survived. Results are produced as csv files with passenger IDs and a boolean value indicating whether or not each passenger survived. Visualizatons are showcased to understand the provided data and features. Datasets are provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).
